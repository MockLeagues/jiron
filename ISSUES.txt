This is a list of open issues and ToDos for Jiron:

- Password rotation has not yet been implemented.

- In the call to "SecretKey k = new SecretKeySpec(key.getEncoded(), "AES");"
  I do not understand on what basis "AES" is picked. If necessary, this
  should either be a constant or be part of the algorithms.

- I have read somewhere (but cannot find it again) that javax.crypto
  key generation functions might actually returns keys shorter than
  the one requested. And that one would need to verify the actual
  keysize after obtaining the key. If that is true, add that check to
  generateKey()

- In generateKey() I do this:

  SecretKey key = keyFactory.generateSecret(keySpec);
  SecretKey k = new SecretKeySpec(key.getEncoded(), "AES"); 
  
  I still do not understand why I have to do these *2* calls. Learn and
  adjust code if necessar.y
